            <p>Before initiating formal proceedings, we agree to attempt to resolve disputes informally for at least 30 days. Please contact us with your concerns at support@padtask.com.</p>

            <h3>13.3 Binding Arbitration</h3>
            <p>If informal resolution fails, any dispute shall be resolved through binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. Arbitration shall take place in Georgia.</p>

            <h3>13.4 Class Action Waiver</h3>
            <p>You agree to resolve disputes with us on an individual basis and waive any right to bring or participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide arbitration.</p>
