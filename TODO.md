# Property Tax Savings - TODO

Focus on simple, user-friendly language. Users care about "annual property tax" and "annual savings" - not technical terms like "homestead exemption" (if they knew what that was, they'd already have it).

## High Priority (Legal)

- [ ] **terms.html** - Remove old appeals language
  - [ ] Section 5.1 "Nature of Service" - references appeals and comparables data
  - [ ] Section 6 "User Responsibilities for Appeals" - entire section focused on appeals
  - [ ] Liability disclaimers reference "appeal success" and "missed appeal deadlines"

## Medium Priority

- [ ] **README.md** - Roadmap still mentions "appeal guidance"

- [ ] **src/README.md** - API documentation references old appeals model
